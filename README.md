# fizz-buzz

I am building a fizzBuzz game as a part of the TOP (the odin project) curriculum.

I will add some modifications, when it comes to displaying results i will use a table instead of a simple console log, just to push myself a little bit more.

I am mentored by my dear friend @alexErdei, he has been with me since the start
