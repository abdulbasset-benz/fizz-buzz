# fizz-buzz

I am building a fizzBuzz game as a part of the TOP (the odin project) curriculum.

## Game logic : FizzBuzz Game


## Description

FizzBuzz is a simple programming game often used as an introductory exercise to teach the basics of coding and conditionals. In this game, participants take turns counting from 1 to a specified number, with a twist:

. If the current number is divisible by 3, they say "Fizz" instead of the number.
. If the current number is divisible by 5, they say "Buzz" instead of the number.
. If the current number is divisible by both 3 and 5, they say "FizzBuzz."
Rules
. Players take turns counting from 1 to a predetermined number.
. If the number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead.
. If the number is divisible by 5, say "Buzz" instead.
. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz."
. If none of the above conditions apply, simply say the current number.

I will add some modifications, when it comes to displaying results i will use a table instead of a simple console log, just to push myself a little bit more.

I am mentored by my dear friend @alexErdei, he has been with me since the start
